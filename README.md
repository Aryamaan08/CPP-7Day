# CPP-7Day
Watch my projects as I learn C++ by trial and error. Not much research.
All I have is an IDE and my little knowledge of C. If I'm stuck, I can get help online.
# Day 1
Not much today. I made a Hello World program, and I experimented with variables (integers) and lists (arrays actually whoops). I also did if else, which is the same as in C.
